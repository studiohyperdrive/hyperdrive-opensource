# Angular Tools: NgxI18nModule (`@studiohyperdrive/ngx-i18n`)

Install the package first:
```shell
npm install @studiohyperdrive/ngx-i18n
```

## 1. Concept
`ngx-1i8n` is a layer on top of `ngx-translate` that allows for a lazy-loaded modular approach to translations. This approach allows the user to split up the translations into several independent files, which can be lazy-loaded whenever they're needed.

This approach only works for module-based projects. There is currently no support for standalone-components.

## 2. Modular

In order for a modular translation system, we provide a `TranslationLoader` to each `forChild` method of the `NgxI18nModule`. This loader uses a similar approach as @rbalet's [MultiTranslateHttpLoader](https://github.com/rbalet/ngx-translate-multi-http-loader).

Using an array of source paths, the translation loader loads in only the provided translations. If one of the assets has previously been loaded by a different module, the translation will be fetched from the cache.

```ts
import { MultiTranslationHttpLoader } from '@studiohyperdrive/ngx-i18n'

export function ExampleTranslationLoader(http: HttpBackend) {
	return new MultiTranslationHttpLoader(http, ['./path-to-translation/']);
}
```

If no custom `TranslationLoader` is provided, than the module will use a fall-back loader which has a default array of paths that can be set in the config file.

## 3. Lazy-loaded
In order to provide a lazy loaded translation system, the translations only get loaded when routing to a specific route. 

For this purpose we've provided a `TranslationLoaderGuard` which will automatically fetch all translations when the application routes to this route.

At any given time you can query the `I18nLoadingService` to see whether the translations have been loaded into the application. There are two Observables provided, being `translationsLoading$` and `translationsFailed$`;

## 4. I18nGuard
The `@studiohyperdrive/ngx-i18n` package also provides us with a `I18nGuard` which will automatically prefix the routes of your application with a language parameter. 

The name of the route parameter is `language` by default, but can be overwritten in the config file. The same config file will also provide the opportunity to define a set of permitted languages and a default language for when no language is provided.

## 5. Setup
In this simple example we'll provide the basic setup for the `NgxI18nModule` approach.

First off, in our root module we provide the `NgxI18nModule` in which we'll configure our basic settings.

```ts
 @NgModule({
    imports: [
        NgxI18nModule.forRoot({
            defaultLanguage: 'nl',
            availableLanguages: ['nl', 'fr'],
            defaultAssetPaths: ['./assets/i18n/shared/', './assets/i18n/ui/']
        })
    ]
 })
 export class AppModule{}
```
Next up, we'll take a look at the lazy loaded feature module. In order to then lazy load our translations, we provide a routing module with the `TranslationResolverGuard` on our root path.

```ts
 import {TranslationLoaderGuard} from '@studiohyperdrive/ngx-i18n';

 const routes = [
    {
        path: '',
        component: FeatureComponent,
        canActivate: [TranslationLoaderGuard]
    }
 ];

 export const FeatureRoutingModule = RoutingModule.forChild(routes);
```

Afterwards, we setup a translation loader for our feature module we'll lazy load.

```ts
import { MultiTranslationHttpLoader } from '@studiohyperdrive/ngx-i18n'

export function FeatureTranslationLoader(http: HttpBackend) {
	return new MultiTranslationHttpLoader(http, ['./assets/i18n/shared/', './assets/i18n/feature']);
}
```

Which we'll then provide to the `NgxI18nModule` in our feature module

```ts
 @NgModule({
    imports: [
        NgxI18nModule.forRoot(FeatureTranslationLoader),
        FeatureRoutingModule
    ]
 })
 export class FeatureModule{}
```
With this setup, the translations will be loaded only when navigating to the FeatureModule.
