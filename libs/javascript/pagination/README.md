This repo contains a set of tools for working with HAL standards.

It is build with:
- node: `v18.x.x` ( ~ `lts/hydrogen`)
- npm: `10.x.x`

For a complete list of packages and version check out the `package.json` file.

## Use

### Install

You can install this package by doing:
``` bash
$ npm install @studiohyperdrive/nodejs-hal-tools
```
or if you use Yarn:
``` bash
$ yarn add @studiohyperdrive/nodejs-hal-tools
```

### In your code
In your code, you can use this package and it's interfaces like this:

```typescript
import { HALFormat } from '@studiohyperdrive/nodejs-hal-tools';

class DoSomething {
  public async findAll(page: number, size: number): Promise<IHALFormat<MyEntity>> {
    const [entities, totalElements] = await this.MyEntitiyRepository.findAndCount(
      calculateTakeSkip(page, size),
    );
    const key = 'my-entities';
    const path = `https://my-api.com/v1/api/${key}`;

    return HALFormat<MyEntity>({
      path,
      key,
      entities,
      page,
      size,
      totalElements,
    });
  }
}
```

This will transform your entities and count to a HAL formatted response which you can return to the client.

#### Parameters
- `path`: The path parameter is optional, if omitted, the _links section is not added
- `maxPages`: An optional parameter that limits the maximum number of pages returned. This can be useful in scenario's with lots of items, where querying with limit/offset can be time consuming. To prevent the user from navigating to e.g. page 599, you can limit that number using the `maxPages` parameter.


### What's in the package?
This package exposes the following functions:
- `calculateTotalPages`: This function will calculate the total amount of pages based on the pagesize & total amount of items.
- `calculatePagination`: This function will calculate and return all pagination properties.
- `calculateNextPage`: This function will calculate your next page or, when there is none, return your current page.
- `createHalLinks`: This function will create a set of links required by the HAL Format.
- `HALFormat`: This function is the main one which will use the above and your input to transform your input to a HAL-formatted object.

And the following interfaces:
- `IHALLink`: An interface for a single HAL link.
- `IHALLinks`: An interface for the `_links` property.
- `IHALEntities`: An interface for the `_embedded` property, takes in an optional `T`.
- `IHALPagination`: An interface for the `_page` property.
- `IHALFormat`: An interface for the HAL formatted object containing the above properties.
- `IHALFormatParams`: An interface for the arguments of the `HALFormat` function.
