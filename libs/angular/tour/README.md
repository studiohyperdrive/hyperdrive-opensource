# Angular Tools: NgxTours (`@studiohyperdrive/ngx-tours`)

`ngx-tour` is light-weight and heavily customizable package to create a help tour through an application using [the CDK overlay](https://material.angular.io/cdk/overlay/overview).

## Installation

Install the package first:

```shell
npm install @studiohyperdrive/ngx-layout
```

## Versioning and build information

This package will follow a semver-like format, `major.minor.patch`, in which:

- `major`: Follows the Angular major version
- `minor`: Introduces new features and (potential) breaking changes
- `patch`: Introduces bugfixes and minor non-breaking changes

For more information about the build process, authors, contributions and issues, we refer to the [hyperdrive-opensource](https://github.com/studiohyperdrive/hyperdrive-opensource) repository.

## Concept

With the tour approach of `ngx-tour`, we aim to create a very light-weight bare bones approach to the help tours. The package requires the user to provide their own styling and components for the steps shown during the tour, ensuring a maximized customizability.
