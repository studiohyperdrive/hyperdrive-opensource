## Concept

`ngx-layout` is a package to help facilitate common layout use-cases.

Currently the package provides a `configurable layout` component which can be used to render components in a grid based on provided templates. This approach is ideal for use-cases such as a custom configurable dashboard. We also provide a fully accessible `accordion` component and an accessible `displayContent` approach to handle loading, error and offline flows.
