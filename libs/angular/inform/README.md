## Concept

`ngx-inform` is a package to help facilitate common user information use-cases such as tooltips, toasts and snackbars.

At its core, `ngx-inform` is build to be WCAG and ARIA compliant, and will throw errors whenever the necessary setup has not been provided to ensure said compliancy.

Currently the package provides a `ngxTooltip` directive which can be used to attach a customizable ARIA compliant tooltip to any component and the `ngxModalService` which allows for both custom and predefined global modals to be used throughout the application.
