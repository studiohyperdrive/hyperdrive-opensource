## Contribute

### Add a new library

To add a new library, consult the Angular CLI documentation:
https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries

After adding your library, make sure to check the karma set-up is consistent with other projects.  
Check the following files:

-   `/angular.json`: `<your project>.architect.test`
-   `/projects/<your-lib>/tsconfig.spec.json`
-   `/projects/<your-lib>/karma.conf.js`
-   `/projects/<your-lib>/src/test.ts`

When adding a playground for your lib, also make sure the project has at least one test or provide a placeholder.

### Publish

The libraries in this project can be published to the npm registry. To do so follow these steps:

1. In the library that you want to publish, bump the version in package & package-lock files.
2. Commit the changes using the following convention: `build(images): v1.0.0`.
3. Add a tag using the following convention: `@studiohyperdrive/ngx-images@v1.0.0`.
4. Make a new production build of your library using `ng build <library>` (Ivy is disable in tsconfig by default for this project).
5. Move to the dist folder of your library using `cd dist/<library>`
6. Publish the package using `npm publish`  
   a. If this is the first time publishing the library make sure to add the `--access public` flag.  
   b. Make sure you are logged into npm and that you have been added to the @studiohyperdrive organisation.
