This library provides a quick and easy wrapper for [CookieConsent V3](https://cookieconsent.orestbida.com).

The `ngx-cookies` package was made as an extension on top of the vanilla CookieConsent in order to provide several Angular based functionalities such as a setup through a server, Observables for the provided events and a directive to handle cookie based content.

The package refrains from adding too much custom logic and is entirely based on the existing CookieConsent API. We refer to the documentation of said package for more information regarding the setup of the cookie handler.
