## For organisations

In a data driven world, our forms package aims to not only streamline the experience of using forms for end-users but also enhance the developer experience creating them, making it easier and faster to make forms of any size and complexity. Through best practices and tried and tested methods, our open source solution offers everything you need to tackle your data needs.

Our focus on **reusability** allows developers to analyze your requirements and ensure that your end-users will experience consistency throughout your entire application so they never feel lost; no matter the size or complexity of your flows! 

By providing a wide variety of **validation methods**, we can cater to your specific needs and ensure that the data you receive is exactly as you need it to be. Our validation methods range from common use-cases such as e-mail validation to complex validation tailored to your own specifications.

Easy to use **error handling and save guards** are implemented so your end-user can easily navigate your forms without risking filling in incorrect information or losing their progress along the way. All of our systems follow **WCAG/WAI-ARIA guidelines**, ensuring that users with disabilities also have the optimal experience.

## For developers

`ngx-forms` is a package that aims to streamline the creation of complex forms and form flows.

The validators of this package provide easy and robust ways to tackle more complex validation requirements, such as various dependency based required flows, as well as smaller frequently used use-cases such as several date related validators.

Simplifying the process of creating (complex) custom `ControlValueAccessors`, `ngx-forms` introduces the `FormAccessor`, `DataFormAccessor` and `FormContainer` approach to provide a quick and easy way to build custom controls and re-usable form components.

To handle errors in a uniform way, `ngx-forms` provides the `NgxErrors` directive approach that will unify all error handling with either the default or a custom defined error component.

Last but not least, the `SaveOnExit` flow of `ngx-forms` allows for a quick and simple solution to the often re-occuring "save-before-you-exit" flow that is common amongst complex form implementation.
