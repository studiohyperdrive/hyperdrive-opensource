`ngx-gov-flanders` is an Angular based package used to easily integrate software solutions made by and for applications relating the Flemish Government.

## For organisations

Encouraged by the synergy between the public and private sector, our open source solutions aim to provide best practices and tried and tested methods that can be used for any application related to the Flemish Government. And so, our new open source package was born!

Our focus on **reusability** allows developers to quickly integrate software solutions provided by the Flemish Government and their partners, ensuring that the focus can remain on creating the best possible solutions to the problems at hand.

All of our systems follow **WCAG/WAI-ARIA guidelines**, ensuring that users with disabilities also have the optimal experience.
