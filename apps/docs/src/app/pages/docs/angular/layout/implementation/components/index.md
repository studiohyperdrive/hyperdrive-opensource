## Accordion

The `ngx-accordion` provides a easy to use WCAG/ARIA compliant implementation for an accordion. Its implementation exists of a `NgxAccordionComponent` and a `NgxAccordionItemComponent` component. Both can be imported simultaneously by importing `NgxAccordion`.

### Implementation

Using the `NgxAccordionComponent` as a container for our accordion items (`NgxAccordionItemComponent`), we are able to provide correct keyboard navigation for end users. Therefore it is important to always warp your items in the container component.

We use content projection to pass the header and the content of each accordion item, by using the `headerTmpl` and `contentTmpl` ng-templates. Both templates allow for fetching the open state of the accordion, by using the $implicit outlet context.

In the example below you can find a simple implementation of the accordion.

{{ NgDocActions.demo("LayoutAccordionDemoComponent", { expanded: true}) }}

### Extra configuration

The `NgxAccordionComponent` allows for opening a set of accordion items from the start. This is useful for when you want to open the first item, or specific items in the accordion. By using the `open` property you can either open all items, the first item, a specific item or a set of specific items by passing `all`, `first`, the index of an item or an array of indexes respectively.

An individual `NgxAccordionItemComponent` can also be disabled by providing the `disabled` property. Once disabled, an item's open or closed state cannot be altered by the user. To allow an item to be open from the start and not closeable by the end-user, the `open` property of the `NgxAccordionComponent` will ignore the disabled state of the individual items.

### Styling

The accordion implementation provides several classes we can use to target elements in the accordion. Internally the `NgxAccordionItemComponent` uses the `details` HTML element.

| Class                 |                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ngx-accordion         | A class set to the `NgxAccordionComponent`.       |
| ngx-accordion-item    | A class set to the `NgxAccordionItemComponent`.   |
| ngx-accordion-content | A class set to the content of the accordion item. |
| ngx-accordion-header  | A class set to the header of the accordion item.  |

## Configurable layout

The `configurable layout` provides the ability to render components in a grid depending on a provided two dimensional array of keys and corresponding items with a provided template. The combination exists of an `ngx-configurable-layout` and an `ngx-configurable-layout-item`.

### Setup

By using content projection, we render our components inside of a `ngx-configurable-layout-item`. Each item requires a `key` as an input, which will be used to match the provided component with the two dimensional array we provide to the `ngx-configurable-layout` component.

This means that the order of rendering is now no longer depended on how you provide the components in the template, but by the two dimensional array provided to the `ngx-configurable-layout` component. This significantly streamlines the process and allows you to easily refactor existing flows. In the chapters below we'll explain how to provide the two dimensional array to the component.

In order to provide an accessible experience for end-users, the earlier mentioned `NgxDragAndDropService` needs to be provided.

### Accessibility

Currently, default texts have been provided for the following languages: Dutch (`nl`), English (`en`), French (`fr`), German (`de`), Spanish (`es`),Portuguese (`pt`), Turkish (`tr`), and Kurdish (`ku`).

In order to further customize the messages for end users with assistive technologies, we can pass several configuration items to the `ngx-configurable-layout` and `ngx-configurable-layout-item`.

By passing an `itemLabel` and a `rowLabel` we can define specific names for the rows and the items within the rows of the `ngx-configurable-layout`. By default, these are `item` and `list`; but you can change these to your own preference.

The `ngx-configurable-layout-item` also has an optional `label` property which can be used to overwrite both the default and the layout defined label for the item.

### Static

Earlier we mentioned that the layout is build up using a provided two dimensional array. Depending on whether you want this layout to be `static` or `editable`, we provide the array in a different fashion.

When making a `static` layout, the layout itself can not be readjusted on the spot by the end user. A good use-case for this could be a dashboard that comes with a predefined set of layouts the user can pick from.

When the `layoutType` of the `ngx-configurable-layout` is set to `static`, the two dimensional array needs to provided through a `keys` input. This input takes a two dimensional array of key strings that match the ones presented in the template.

Below is a simple example for a static configurable layout.

{{ NgDocActions.demo("LayoutConfigurableDemoComponent", { expanded: true}) }}

### Editable

Unlike with the `static` layout, the `editable` layout allows the user to readjust on the spot by the end user. This means that the end user can toggle items and ,when enabled, reorder these items through drag and drop. A use-case that fits this approach is a fully configurable dashboard, where an end user can pick and choose which items they wish to see.

When setting the `layoutType` to `editable`, the two dimensional array is provided by attaching a `FormControl` to the `ngx-configurable-layout`. Unlike with the `keys` input, the control expects an object with a `key` and an `isActive` property. The latter will be used to let the end user toggle items within the view.

As long as the `showInactive` property is set to false, the inactive items will not be shown in the view. By setting it to true, the inactive items become visible, including a toggle that gets attached to all the items in the view. This toggle allows the items in the view be toggled on and off.

If you for some reason do not wish to make an item in the list toggable, you can set individual items in the control as disabled. You can do this by simply setting the `disabled` property of the item in the two dimensional array to true. This will prevent the toggle from being shown and the corresponding item will receive the class `ngx-layout-item-disabled`.

By default, the toggle is represented by a default html checkbox in the top right corner of the item. This checkbox has the `ngx-layout-item-toggle` class. This toggle however can be overwritten by using the custom `checkboxTmpl` template.

Below is a simple example for an editable configurable layout.

{{ NgDocActions.demo("LayoutEditableDemoComponent", { expanded: true}) }}

### Drag and drop

`ngx-configurable-layout` provides drag and drop through the Angular CDK implementation. By default, the drag and drop functionality is disabled, and can be enabled through `allowDragAndDrop`.

By default, the package uses the demo styling provided by the Angular CDK team. This can be overwritten by custom styling, using the classes provided in the section `Styling`.

When `allowDragAndDrop` is enabled, we can pass a `dropPredicate`. This function is bound to the layout component and will allow you to determine whether dropping an element in a specific spot is allowed by returning true or false. For more information on the predicate, we refer to the CDK Drag and Drop documentation.

### Item size

To determine how much space an item takes up in the grid, we use the `itemSize` input.

By using the option `fill`, which is the default option, the components will be sized to maximize filling up the grid.

By using the option `fit-content`, the size of the components themselves will define how much space they take up.

By using the option `equal`, all items in the entire grid will take up an equal amount of space. This also applies to the height of the elements, but this will require you to set the height of your items to `height:100%` for this to take effect.

### Gaps

In order to create spacing between items in the layout, `ngx-configurable-layout` provides two inputs, `columnGap` and `rowGap`.

Both properties expect a CSS based amount (in px, rem, %, etc.) and are both optional. This is the preferred way of adding spacing between your items, as using margins can sometimes create unexpected results due to the CSS Grid based implementation.

### Styling

By default, `ngx-configurable-layout` always provides minimal styling. Several classes are provided to further style the grid as needed.

| Class                          |                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ngx-layout-grid                | The overarching grid container used by the `ngx-configurable-layout`        |
| ngx-layout-row                 | A row in the `ngx-configurable-layout`                                      |
| ngx-layout-item                | A cell in the `ngx-configurable-layout`                                     |
| ngx-layout-drag-placeholder    | A class to style the custom placeholder used when drag and drop is enabled. |
| ngx-layout-item-toggle         | A class to style the default checkbox used in `editable` layouts.           |
| ngx-layout-item-inactive       | A class to style the inactive items used in `editable` layouts.             |
| ngx-layout-item-disabled       | A class to style the disabled items used in `editable` layouts.             |
| ngx-layout-grid-inactive-shown | A class given to the container when the inactive items are being shown.     |


## Image marker

The `ngx-image-marker` components provides the ability to visualize and add annotations to an image by using both the [MarkerJs2 and the MarkerLive packages ](https://markerjs.com/). 

**Important:** Due to the nature of the package and ZoneJS, some of the features from MarkerJs2 are overwritten with an Angular approach, as they currently do not work with ZoneJS.

### Setup

To setup the `ngx-image-marker`, we simply need to provide an image url to `image` and a description of the image to the `imageDescription` input of the component. From there on out, we can add and visualize annotations to the provided image.

We can switch between edit mode and view mode by using the `canEdit` Input. Simultaneously we can add starter data by providing `startState`. 

The `stateUpdated` Output will emit whenever a change has been made to the annotations during edit mode, whilst `markerClicked` will emit whenever a marker is clicked during view mode.

Additionally, we can pass a set of `markerTypes` we want the MarkerJs package to be restricted to. It's important to know that we need to provide markers for both the view and the edit mode, given they both use different packages and interfaces; being `marker-live` and `markerjs2` respectively.

### Future improvements

In the future we aim to make the `ngx-image-marker` work as a `ControlValueAccessor`. Both the current and a form based implementations will be supported initially. At a later date, based on input through a [RFC](https://github.com/studiohyperdrive/hyperdrive-opensource/discussions) we might change that.

### Styling
By default, `ngx-image-marker` always provides minimal styling from the marker packages. These classes have been set by the `ngx-image-marker` component and match with the corresponding classes of the marker package.

We refer to the [styling settings documentation](https://markerjs.com/reference/interfaces/istylesettings.html) for more information regarding these classes.

| Class                                  |                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ngx-image-marker-notes-area            | notesAreaStyleClassName                                             |
| ngx-image-marker-toolbar               | toolbarStyleColorsClassName                                         |
| ngx-image-marker-toolbox               | toolboxStyleColorsClassName                                         |
| ngx-image-marker-toolbar-button        | toolbarButtonStyleColorsClassName                                   |
| ngx-image-marker-toolbar-button-active | toolbarActiveButtonStyleColorsClassName                             |
| ngx-image-marker-toolbox-button        | toolboxButtonStyleColorsClassName                                   |
| ngx-image-marker-toolbox-button-active | toolboxActiveButtonStyleColorsClassName                             |

### Accessibility
Currently, both the [MarkerJs2 and the MarkerLive packages ](https://markerjs.com/) do not allow for keyboard interaction. Because of that, it is important to correctly inform users about the WCAG/WAI-ARIA implications.

Efforts are being made to improve the WCAG/WAI-ARIA compliance of the package, but no deadline has been set at the time of writing.
