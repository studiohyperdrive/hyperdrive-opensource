`ngx-tour` is light-weight and heavily customizable package to create a help tour through an application using [the CDK overlay](https://material.angular.io/cdk/overlay/overview).

With the tour approach of `ngx-tour`, we aim to create a very light-weight bare bones approach to the help tours. The package requires the user to provide their own styling and components for the steps shown during the tour, ensuring a maximized customizability.
