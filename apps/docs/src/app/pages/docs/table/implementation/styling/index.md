By default the `ngx-table` comes with very minimal styling. Several classes have been provided to help with styling specific parts of the table. As the package was built upon the `cdk-table`, all styling rules that apply to that table also apply here. Check out the documentation of the `cdk-table` for more information.

If you wish to provide a custom class to the row of your tables, you can provide the class name to the `rowClass` Input.

Cells can also have a default class we want to provide to all cells of that kind. All `ngx-date-table-cell` cells have the `ngx-date-table-cell` class and the same applies for the `ngx-currency-table-cell`.
