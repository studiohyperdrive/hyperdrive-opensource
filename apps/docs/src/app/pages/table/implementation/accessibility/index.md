`ngx-table` provides a WCAG and ARIA compliant implementation to tables. When a table has a detail row or is selectable, the role of the table switches from `table` to `treegrid`. Because of that, `ngx-table` follows the [WAI ARIA Treegrid Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treegrid/).
